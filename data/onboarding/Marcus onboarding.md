Ok, let's start with WORK: 
Im the founder + Creative CEO of FIELD.IO a design studio based in London, UK + Berlin, DE.

You can find us here: http://www.field.io
And more about me: https://www.marcuswendt.io/


It's Jan 5, we're back to work after a busy 2025. Priorities right now are:

- HR key hires for finance, shift from dual-headed to distributed leadership
- 2026 Strategy + Setting priorities
- Our cashflow + new biz pipeline (as always)
- Continuing this discussion with my MD about his role
- Brand + PR (which feeds into newbiz)
- Our Berlin studio plans
- Our Hong Kong expansion plans 

and in general providing leadership and vision to our team of ~50 employees!


Artists that I keep coming back to as well as recent discoveries:

**Jorinde Voigt** — Drawing as data visualization of internal states; making the invisible (emotion, memory, atmosphere) visible

**Silvano Zeiter** — Imperfection as authenticity; immersive images that blur memory and reality

**Ezra Miller** — Fleeting moments caught between abstraction and recognition; articulating emotions words can't reach

**David Schnell** — Fragmented landscapes as meditations on modern perception; nature and industry in perpetual tension

**Sho Shibuya** — Daily ritual as discipline; reducing chaos to the essential through quiet, sustained attention

SIDE-PROJECTS:

I'm currently exploring several product / startup ideas that may feed into FIELD's work or become adjacent businesses or simply vibe coding creative exercises... we will see, here's an overview:

- Meridian: A personal fitness command center with AI coaching for serious endurance athletes. It aggregates data from Strava, WHOOP, and Withings into a unified dashboard with an intelligent training advisor that adapts to your life.

- Cascade: A visual programming framework for creative coders who want the clarity of node-based workflows without sacrificing the power of real code. It combines TypeScript/JavaScript programming with a professional-grade graph editor, built-in image processing, and multi-provider AI integration—all running locally on your machine.

- Lucient: An AI-native operating system for physical spaces that transforms retail environments, museums, and venues into intelligent, responsive experiences. It combines privacy-first edge AI sensing, behavioral analytics, and real-time content adaptation—enabling spaces to understand and respond to human presence without compromising privacy. Built on 15 years of spatial intelligence work for Nike, Chanel, and On Running, now productized as a scalable platform.
...

- Streifzüge: Is my artistic practice focused on capturing fleeting moments and internal experiences through a combination of written reflections and visual companions. The name—German for "forays" or "wanderings"—reflects the exploratory nature of the work: constraint-based daily captures anchored to specific locations, dates, and states of presence, then refined into flat, confident color treatments that reduce landscapes to essential shapes while preserving emotional resonance.

... and many many unfinished explorations.
